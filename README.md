# Narrative
You know Octocat from the Github logo, but no one knows the origin of the cat on the 404 screen, even though everyone knows it by sight. GitHub’s mascot is an anthropomorphized “octocat” with five octopus-like arms. The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock. GitHub bought and trademarked the character along with the Octocat name. Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials. McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character, which are available on The Octodex. Octobi Wan Catnobi is on of them that now used for 404 error page

**Octobi Wan $CATNOBI is not like other memes. Its first unique token that was born on github and powered by github. From Devs to believers with love 🩵💙💜**
